Welcome to the Rubin Observatory Science Platform Notebook Aspect.

Find useful documentation for the software and Notebook Aspect at:

The Rubin Observatory Science Pipelines environment is in:

        /opt/lsst/software/stack

If you want to add your own configuration to LSST environment startup in the
LSST iPython kernel, create a sourceable shell fragment in:

        ${HOME}/notebooks/.user_setups

and it will be sourced during kernel startup.
