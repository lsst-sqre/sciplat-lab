# Since the base image wipes all the apt caches to clean up the image that

# Install various dependencies for runtime.

# build-essential: sometimes needed to build Python modules
# git: required by setuptools_scm
# libffi-dev: sometimes needed to build cffi, a cryptography dependency
# libxss1 ... pandoc: needed for export of notebooks in various formats
# libdigest-md5-file-perl ... file: generally useful utilities
# man: it is an interactive system, after all
# curl: required to download the DM stack installer
# nano ... ed: enough editors to cover most people's habits
