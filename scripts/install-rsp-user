# These are the things that are not available on conda-forge.

# lower-level layers have already installed the package, pinned to a version
# they need, we won't upgrade it.  But if it isn't already installed, we'll
# just take the latest available.  `--no-build-isolation` ensures that any
# source packages use C++ libraries from conda-forge, and that we're also
# responsible for the dependencies not already provided by something in the
# conda env.  In this case, structlog and symbolicmode from lsst-rsp.
